 *    a) Store iMesh file name in iField (perhaps reverse as well).
 *       This will probably require methods specifically for this task
 *       in both interfaces.
 *    b) Store iMesh and iField instances to the same file. This is

 *       of one piece, you can construct the other and vice versa.
 *       This is the simplest strategy but feels kludgy. 
 *    d) Ignore the problem. Let the applications worry about it. I
 *       think this is just asking for trouble.
 *    e) A 'meta' file containing the iField/iMesh filenames.
 *       An xml-ish meta file might serve us well here.
 * Note: the above assumes all fields are in one file. But the save
 * call defined here doesn't necessarily REQUIRE that. Perhaps it
 * should. If we somehow loose track of the mesh file, then all of
 * our field data is pretty much totally useless.
 * If this function is called multiple times for different fields in the

 * we're asking for serious I/O performance problems. On the other hand,
 * if the caller passes a different filename each time, then the impl.

\page ifield iField: ITAPS Field Interface

\section INTRO Overview

The iField interface is intended to provide support for tensor fields
and collections of tensor fields, with a strong bias towards supporting
first and best the capabilities required for scientific computing
applications.

Scientific computing applications deal in physical quantities expressed
as tensors: scalars such as temperature, vectors such as velocity, and
second-order tensors such as stress. In practice, these are formally
tensor fields: a tensor field assigns a tensor to each point in a
mathematical space (typically a Euclidean space or manifold).

Because tensors have a geometric interpretation, their underlying
physical meaning is independent of the coordinate system in which they
are defined; the numerical value of a tensor depends on the coordinate
system, and so any numerical instantiation of a tensor field is
incomplete without a specification of its coordinate system.

The ITAPS Field interface represents a field as a linear combination of
distribution functions and degrees of freedom (dof's): $\sum_{i} w_{i}
f_{i} \left(\vec{x}\right)$.  For typical discrete fields, the
distribution functions $f_{i}$ have compact support over a single
highest-dimensional mesh entity, and are each more or less associated
with a mesh entity, which may be of lower dimension; for instance, the
interpolation functions used in the finite element method may be
associated with a vertex, edge, face, or region. These distribution
functions are known in advance. The degrees of freedom $w_{i}$ are
associated with both an entity and a distribution function; calculation
of these degrees of freedom is the goal of a typical scientific computing
application.

An ITAPS Field is, for practical purposes, a function. The
representation of the function will, in most use cases, be piecewise and
will not necessarily by continuous (never mind smooth), but with
reasonable definitions in a few tight spots, a Field is in fact a
function.

In addition to supporting physical tensor fields, there's a reasonable
argument for allowing integer or boolean values for fields.  While these
don't represent physical tensors, and need to be restricted to scalars
(coordinate transforms for vectors of booleans, anyone?), applications
do and will continue to want to use such things.  This case implies
certain restrictions on distribution functions for integer and boolean
scalar "fields" and on the operations one can perform on them.

To support this representation of Fields and the sorts of operations on
Fields that applications require, we need precise definitions of the
domain of a function, of the data that a Field represents, and of how we
relate the domain and range for a Field.

\section ADM Abstract Data Model

\subsection DOM Domain

\subsubsection Preliminary Definitions

Primitive SET (pSET) An infinite point set corresponding, topologically,
  to an iMesh or iGeom Entity.

  Examples:

    iMesh_TRIANGLE
    iMesh_HEXAHEDRON

The key feature of a pSET is its topology and the adjacency information
implied by, for instance, knowing the identities of the faces, edges,
and vertices on the closure of a region.  Geometric information
(locations of vertices, shapes of higher-dimensional entities) is a
separate matter.

Pre-Domain: The union of a collection of primitive point sets; that is,
  an iMesh or iGeom EntitySet.

A pre-domain is a topological description of the domain; specifically,
it has no coordinates associated with it to define the spatial location
of iMesh and iGeom Entities. It represents an infinite point set on
which the field will be defined, decomposed into iMesh/iGeom primitives
(pSETs) with adjacency information to knit those pSETs together to cover
the infinite point set.



Domain (mesh based)

The domain of a field is expressed, at the lowest level, by a collection
of mesh entities over which the field is defined.  This collection can
potentially be expressed in multiple ways: as the entities in an iMesh
entity set (in many use cases, the root set) or as the mesh entities
related (by iRel) to one or more iGeom entities.

Loose coupling between mesh topology and geometry is a benefit in
several cases --- including mesh smoothing/relaxation, shape
optimization, and deforming domain problems.  This suggests that some
cooperation between iMesh and iField is ideal for handling
coordinates, with some cases handled strictly through iMesh, others
strictly through iField, and some jointly.

For practical reasons, the iMesh specification defines one very
important field; the coordinate field. In addition, the iMesh
specification defines only the most common coordinate field
representation; a piecewise linear, Lagrange field. Support for more
sophisticated coordinate fields will be possible but only through
iField, not through iMesh's 'native' coordinate field representation.

When a new mesh is instantiated, an iMesh client will indicate if the
mesh will employ iMesh's 'native' coordinate field representation or not
via a new boolean argument to iMesh_newMesh()

void iMesh_newMesh(
    const char *options,
        Pointer to implementation-specific options string
    int lagrange_coords,
        flag indicating if iMesh' lagrange coordinates will be used
    iMesh_Instance *instance,
        Pointer to iMesh instance handle returned from function
    int *err,
        Pointer to error type returned from function
    int options_len
        Length of the character string pointed to by options
);

If 'int lagrange_coords' is zero (false)...

    that means the coordinate field for the mesh will be handled
    through iField. In this case, the iMesh implementation is free
    to do whatever it wishes with coordinate values passed via
    createVtx calls including ignoring that data entirely and not
    even storing it. Calls to either iMesh_getVtxArrCoords or
    iMesh_getVtxCoord will return no coordinate data and set the err
    return to iBase_NO_LAGANGE_COORDS. Calls to
    iMesh_setVtxArrCoords and iMesh_setVtxCoord() will make no
    attempt to interpret coordinate data passed in and will likewise
    return err set to iBase_NO_LAGANGE_COORDS. Calls to
    iMesh_createVtxArr and iMesh_createVtx will make no attempt to
    interepret coordinate data passed in (e.g. will not attempt to
    de-reference pointers to coordinate values), but will return
    iBase_SUCCESS.
        
    Note, even if iField is later used to define a coordinate field
    that is in fact a piecewise-linear, lagrange coordinate field
    for the mesh, there will be no obligation that that fields dofs
    make its way into the iMesh mesh instance such that it be
    managed by iMesh as it otherwise ordinarily would have.

Otherwise, 'int lagrange_coords' is non-zero (true) and...

    that means the coordinate field for the mesh will be handled
    BOTH through iMesh AND through iField. By 'BOTH', here that does
    not mean that data is redundantly stored. It only means that it
    is redundantly accessible through set/getVtx methods in iMesh as
    well as set/getDof methods in iField.  For some implementations,
    this will require a different access/storage method for this
    particular type of coordinate field than for other fields.

\subsection TENSOR Representing Tensor Data

Tensor Templates

A tensor template is intended to define all of the information about a
physical tensor that is dependent only on the physical quantity being
represented.  For instance, a 3D velocity vector is always a 3-vector of
real numbers and represents a length/time.  A 2D stress tensor is always
a 2nd-order tensor (2x2) of real numbers and represents a force/area
(mass-length/(time^2 length^2)).  Electric field is a 3D vector of real
numbers and represents a force/unit charge.  These statements will be
true for any 3D velocity or 2D stress or 3D electric field, regardless
of system of units, coordinate system, precision of stored values, etc.

Important things to know about a tensor template

  Tensor order (integer) 0 for scalars, 1 for vectors, 2 for
  tensors mapping one vector to another, etc.

  Number of tensor components (integer) Is this a 2-vector, a
  3-vector, etc.

  Algebraic type (enumeration) This describes the rules for
  combining values and/or the range of legal values. For
  instance, real numbers, complex numbers, barycentric coordinate
  vectors, and quaternions all have different algebraic rules.

  Quantity (handle) See definition later in this document.

\subsection DFUNC Distribution Functions on Meshes

At this stage, the focus is on making the easy things easy. The easiest
case for distribution functions on meshes is the case where each entity
has the same set of distribution functions; that is, the case in which
the field representation is the same for every highest (topological)
dimensional entity.  Note that this does not preclude things like linear
elements for pressure and quadratic for velocity (these are, after all,
different fields and can have different dfuncs).  Nor does this preclude
things like edge-based elements: these split a typical shape function
over multiple regions (as do other continuous FE methods).  Note also
that the definition refers to the highest TOPOLOGICAL dimension entity:
this implies that a field can be defined over a collection of faces
(say, all or part of a boundary), with dfuncs defined over the faces.

Distribution functions and their derivatives will be hard-coded in a
distribution function kernel (DFK), which will contain all information
required to evaluate all distribution functions (and their gradients,
etc) for that highest-dimensional entity (HDE).  In practice, this takes
the form of a callback from the implementation to some external
distribution function kernel, which will evaluate a specified dfunc (one
of perhaps many for the HDE) as a specified location in a specified
entity.

In this scenario, each distribution function (dfunc) has support over
exactly one highest (topological) dimensional entity; one or more
distribution functions (dfuncs) can be have the same highest-dimensional
entity as their support. Each distribution function has exactly one
degree of freedom (dof) associated with it per tensor component. The
dfunc and dof may be associated directly with a vertex, edge, or face
instead of a region (think high-order FE). The dofs and dfuncs must have
a common ordering, dictated by the DFK and understood by the
application.  The implementation needs only to know how to call the DFK
callback and sum dof*dfunc value at a point.

As a practical matter, it is obviously very important to know how to
convert global coordinates into local coordinates and vice versa, as the
dfuncs will necessarily have to use local coordinates. Obvious choices
like barycentric and shifted cartesian coordinates could be specified in
an enum, but the current API anticipates that there will be a wide and
weird enough range of local coordinate systems that it makes sense for
the DFK to include functions for coordinate conversion in both
directions, as well as the Jacobian of the transformation.

The More General Case

More generally, it's often desirable to define distribution functions
that are not associated with highest-dimensional entities, or that are
have a support that extends beyond a single HDE.  Examples of this include
vertex-centered finite-volume schemes (dfunc associated with a vertex,
with support over parts of all regions incident on that vertex),
spectral-like methods, and filtering or convolution kernels.  Although
details have not yet been worked out, the interface for supporting these
types of DFK's is likely to bear some syntactic and semantic resemblence
to the iMeshP ghost descriptions.

Examples (all dof counts for tets at this point...)

  Galerkin FE (quadratic)
     One dof/vertex, one dof/edge, zero dof/face, zero dof/region.
     Local coordinates: barycentric.
     Code for 10 dfuncs (standard shape functions) must be provided.

  Discontinuous Galerkin (cubic)
     Zero dof/vertex, zero dof/edge, zero dof/face, twenty dof/region.
     Local coordinates: barycentric.
     Code for 20 dfuncs (standard shape functions) must be provided.

  Cell-centered FV (quadratic)
     Zero dof/vertex, zero dof/edge, zero dof/face, 10 dof/region.
     Local coordinates: cartesian w/ origin at centroid.
     Code for 10 dfuncs (monomials) must be provided.

  Vertex-centered FV (quadratic)
     10 dof/vertex, zero dof/edge, zero dof/face, zero dof/region.
     Local coordinates: cartesian w/ origin at vertex(?), plus a filter
       function that selects which vertex-centered control volume that
       covers part of a region the point actually falls into (filter
       function uses local barycentric coords).
     Code for 10 dfuncs (monomials) must be provided.
     Note: this is a bit of a hack; in practice most field evals that a
       solver does are already pre-identified with a CV.  This is a case
       that cries out for a more sophisticated approach to defining
       support of dfuncs.

     
\subsection Tensor Field

A tensor field is an intermediate step in instantiating a tensor
template: at this level, units, data precision, a type for physical
coordinates, a distribution function kernel and a domain are added.

  Units (handle) See definition later in this document.

  Coordinate type (enum): Possible values include cartesian,
  cylindrical, and spherical. This is critical for tensor
  transformations.

  DFK   See above.

  Data precision.  This identifies whether floating point data is stored
  in single, double, or quad precision.  This enumeration may need to be
  expanded.

  Domain


In addition to fields that describe single physical tensors, it is often
convenient in scientific computing to have multiple tensor fields stored
and accessed together.  For instance, in incompressible flow, a vector
velocity and scalar pressure are both required, and often stored
interleaved (uvwPuvwP...) to improve cache hit rates.  To support this
common usage --- including making it relatively easy for implementations
to store variables together --- the iField API includes a function to
create a collection of tensor fields together as well as an overall
field that acts as a container for these multiple tensors.  In a
possible abuse of the data model, these compound fields use the same
data type as regular tensor fields; implementations are required to be
able to distinguish between the two.  Some queries for a tensor field
can not be reasonably answered for a compound field; these cases are
noted in the API spec.

Glossary

Coordinate system How space is laid out and measured. A
  coordinate system may be local or global, and either may be
  physical or parametric. Common examples will surely include
  cartesian, polar, spherical, and barycentric coordinates.
  User-defined coordinate systems can be infinite in variety,
  obviously. Each coordinate field will be associated with a
  coordinate system; a coordinate system can apply to many
  coordinate fields. More on this when coordinate fields come
  into the interface in earnest.

  Key functionality: conversion to/from cartesian, plus producing
  the metric and Jacobian info required for differentiation and
  integration.

Quantity Measurable physical property of phenomena/bodies/substances.
	 
    Examples: mass, length, time, acceleration, volume, power,
      force, illuminance

  Any Quantity can be expressed in terms of the seven basic physical
  quantities, corresponding to the seven base units of the SI system:
  mass, length, time, temperature, electric charge, luminous intensity
  and amount of substance. A Quantity has the following data

  (required) int[7] num_powers; Powers of 7 basic quantities in
    numerator

  (required) int[7] den_powers; Powers of 7 basic quantities in
    denominator

  (required) int flags; bool bits to indicate e.g.
    intensive/extensive, conserved, etc.

  (optional) char *name; name of quantity

  (optional) char *abbr; abbreviation of quantity.

  Operations: 7 basic quantities are pre-defined and guaranteed
  to always exist. New, derived, quantities are defined by
  multiplying together old ones.

  Notes:

  It useful to distinguish a quantity representing a mass
    fraction (e.g. mass/mass) from a quantity representing a
    volume fraction (e.g. volume/volume) for example.

  Essentially there are two kinds of quantities; base quantities
  and derived quantities. Base quantities are, by necessity,
  defined by the data model specification itself and are
  guaranteed to exist. Derived quantities shall be definable by
  applications as necessary. See
  physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/units.html for detailed discussion.

  Unit An adopted convention for assigning a numerical value to a
  Quantity. A Unit has

  (required) handle quant; the Quantity the unit is a measure for

  (required) double scale; scale of this unit relative to the
    default unit of measure for quant.

  (optional) double offset; likewise for offset units

  (optional) double logbase; likewise for log-related units

  (optional) double logcoef; likewise for log-related units

  (optional) char *name;

  (optional) char *abbr;

  Examples:

  slug is a unit of measure of the quantity mass

  pound is a unit of measure of the quantity force

  minute is a unit of measure of the quantity time

  meters/second is a unit of measure of the quantity velocity

  furlongs/fortnight is a unit of measure of the quantity
    velocity

  decibels is a (log scaled) unit of measure of the quantity
    power.

  degrees Fahrenheit is a (offset) unit of measure of the
    quantity thermodynamic temperature.

  Operations:

  Associate a Unit (of measure) with a Quantity

  Combine Unit A and Unit B producing new Unit C by scale factor
    and optional power.

  Set log and/or offset scaling of Unit A relative to Unit B

  Unit System A collection of quantities together with default
  units for them. A Unit System has

  (required) handle bunits[7]; default units for 7 base
    quantities.

  (optional) char *name; name of this unit system

  (optional) handle dunits*; default units for any derived
    quantities that are NOT deriveable from bunits.

  Examples:

  International System of Units (SI) is an example of a system of
    units where default units for base quantities are meters,
    kilograms, seconds, amperes, kelvin, mole, candela. From
    these, derived units for velocity, for example,
    meters/second, current density, amperes/meter^2, etc.

  A and B Divisions at LLNL use default units such as 10
    nanoseconds for time, centimeters for length, etc.

    Notes: If in a given iMesh/iField instance we ever wind up
    mixing field objects created by different applications, then
    it is very likely going to be necessary to be able to
    explicitly set units for any given field (e.g. use something
    other than the default determined by some Unit System).
    This will be especially true if in any given iMesh/iField
    instance we support only one 'active' Unit System.

  It might be nice to allow applications to refer to systems of
  units by name rather than having to create them from scratch as
  needed.

\section Other Notes and Comments

   MCM: 'Precision' is potentially confusing here, particularly since this
   list is not either all floating point formats or all integer formats. Shouldn't
   this list really come out of iBase anyways and/or shouldn't we extend iBase
   to include types needed by iField?

   MCM: The notion expressed here seems to be a kind of hybrid of the data type
   as well as operations it supports. None of these are really algebraic types
   in the sense that I introduced that term for this API. 

   Though I see the possible value in distinguishing between dofs obeying
   boolean algebra semantics and those obeying say complex number semantics,
   that isn't what I had originally introduced the notion of algebraic type
   to support.

   At the same time, we're missing entirely the notion of vector valued and
   tensor valued fields here as well as 'scalar' which all the examples below
   are really instances of certain classes of algebraic types of 'scalar'.

   If it was just a matter of distinguishing between scalar, vector and tensor
   type things, we'd simply declare all fields to be 'tensor valued' and just
   specify the tensor order (which we do anyways). But, that then misses the
   nuances of integral valued vs. real valued vs. complex valued (what about
   integral-complex? digital signal processing codes have to deal with this
   issue). 

   Also, for something like 'complex', that involves 2 things, not one. And,
   those things could be real-imaginary pairs (cartesian) or magnitude-phase
   pairs (polar). In other words, there is a tiny little 'coordinate system'
   that defines how values of the field (thats the range set of the domain-range
   pair of sets needed to define a function) are interpreted. For a quaternion,
   there would be 4 things. I mention quaternion only to help in understanding
   how to properly generalize and abstract this. Even for a single thing (number),
   there is a difference between just that number and that number multiplying
   a vector, say the unit X direction vector. One is a scalar, the other is a
   vector even though both involve only a single number, the magnitude in the X
   direction. In other words, 'a' is different from 'a multiplying x-hat'. The
   latter is what you'd call the 'component' of some vector field and that is
   qualitatively different from something that is truly a scalar value'd field.

   The issue with whether or not the values of a field take on only discrete
   (integral or boolean even) values is a statement about the range set
   (of the domain<->range pair that we're defining a function between. It says
   whether or not the set is 'continuous' or 'discrete' as in the difference
   between the real number line and the integers.

   I think this best way to handle these notions is a slightly more complex API
   for defining algebraic types similar to the DFK api already being developed.

   CFOG reply:
   Mark, I don't see (at least yet) why the combination of tensor order,
   precision, and algebraic type doesn't cover the cases you discuss.  I
   agree that there may be some overlap.  Would be be better off keeping
   precision (bool, int, float, double, quad, ???) and having this
   variable tell us only real/complex/??? ?  I think I'd prefer not to
   roll the two together (nearly doubling the number of precisions).  In
   any event, all three of the pieces of info in my first sentence are
   going to be needed to decide on storage. 

   Before we go making this a user-extensible kind of thing, I'd
   definitely want to see real, concrete use cases that aren't covered
   by something simple.

\section Define possible storage hints for a tensor
  
   Depending on application context, the optimal way to store field data
   may differ.  For instance, a flow solver may prefer dofs for
   each entity to be stored contiguously (in an array of all dofs) for
   efficient access while an adaptation scheme may prefer dofs to be
   associated directly with entities so that dofs can be created and
   destroyed with entities.
  
   The application can provide suggestions to an implementation about
   what dof storage pattern is likely to be advantageous using the
   values enumerated here.  An implementation may or may not choose to
   take advantage of the hint.  Either way, the implementation is still
   responsible for correctly responding to all iField queries.
  
   Values of the enumeration are currently iField_BLOCKED,
   iField_INTERLEAVED, iField_MIXED, and iField_PER_ENTITY. 
  
   Block implies that a scalar temperature (T) and velocity (u,v,w) in a
   compound field are desired to be stored as: 
      (TTTTTT...uuuuuu...vvvvvv...wwwwww...).
   For a simple velocity field, omit the T's in this example.
  
   Interleaved implies that a scalar temperature (T) and velocity
   (u,v,w) in a compound field are desired to be stored as: 
      (TuvwTuvwTuvwTuvwTuvwTuvw...).
   For a simple velocity field, omit the T's in this example.
  
   Mixed implies that a scalar temperature (T) and velocity (u,v,w) in a
   compound field are desired to be stored as: 
       (TTTTTT...uvwuvwuvwuvwuvwuvw...).
   For simple fields, this option is not allowed.
  
   Per entity implies that the app wants data associated with entities
   to support mesh modification / adaptation.  (Yes, these can be
   supported using array-based storage, but it's harder that way.)
  
   MCM or FD: We can't support the case where a caller has 3 separate
   arrays one for X, one for Y and one for Z. That seems like way too
   common a case to NOT handle. In fact, for many rank=1 or 2 tensor
   fields, this is a real common storage paradigm. All we really need to
   do to handle this case is add iField_SEPARATE.
  
   CFOG reply:  For data stored internally in the iField implementation,
   how does iField_SEPARATE differ functionally from iField_BLOCKED?
   Whether I use one array or separate arrays, I'm pretty sure that
   minor pointer magic in the implementation will result in identical
   machine code.

   CFOG 9/26/10  I can definitely see wanting to iterate separately over
   entities with different dfuncs.  Should these be separate calls to
   create iterators, or additional args to the existing iterator calls?

   Also, IMO, apps are responsible for ensuring sensible behavior in the
   transitional cases (entities with some faces p-refined but not all,
   say.  If nothing else, how this is dealt with depends on what dfuncs
   you combine, so the implementation needs guidance anyway.  Caveat
   user.

   NOTES / QUESTIONS / TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION:
  
   Placeholder: At a minimum, we need to be able to represent tensor
   product spaces $(\Re^{n}\times\Re)$ --- space-time is the most common
   but by no means only example.  Regardless of details, this requires
   more thought.
  
   Placeholder: Variable order (p-refinement)
  
   Placeholder: Thread safety: atomic += and lock/unlock?  Or strictly
   up to implementation?
  
   Placeholder:  Returning mixed real / int data.  Up-convert to double?
  
   Placeholder:  dfunc kernel support:  iBase_Type, plus indication of
   dual? 
  
   1.  Being able to express relationships between fields is a useful
       capability, even if iField does nothing more than store the
       relationship and emit it on demand.  We discussed differential
       and algebraic operators; others are possible as well.  Evaluation
       of these operators is something that is probably best done as a
       service (implementations could of course choose to implement this
       service directly, making operations on their own fields more
       efficient...).  We tentatively concluded that this capability is
       unlikely to affect the core of the iField API and may even be
       orthogonal to most or all of the rest of the API.
  
   4.  Coordinate consistency: I am thinking there is an argument for
       creating a (non-coordinate) field using a mesh topology and a
       coordinate field.  The latter would carry info about cartesian
       vs. polar, etc.  Physical coordinates passed to that field (and
       its component tensors and dfuncs, where appropriate) would be in
       that coordinate systems.  There are some obvious advantages to
       enforcing coordinate system consistency in this way, but also
       some possible disadvantages.  Any thoughts on this?
  
   5.  We may want functions to be able to iterate over all dof clusters
       (dofs associated with the same entity) for things like changes of
       variables and/or coordinate system. Otherwise, you either have to
       retrieve all the dofs at once to do this, or duplicate work by
       doing the conversion (in a copy mode) multiple times for shared
       dofs, or keep track of which dofs you have done.
